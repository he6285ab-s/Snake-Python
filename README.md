# snake-python
A simple snake game programmed in Python as a hobby project. 

The goal was to understand Python better and see similarities/differences to Java by 
developing snake again in yet another language. Focus has firstly been on understanding 
the code (since it's an unfamiliar language) and making it function, 
secondly on making it readable to others. This approach will never be used in the future.
